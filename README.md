let's get started ->

1. Open command prompt (right click and run as admin)

wsl --install   (run this command it will take some time to install and if asked for password input your preferred password)

after successful installation -> restart your computer

now search "ubuntu" in search bar and run it as administrator.

2. Install Rust

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

wait for few mins

3. Install Solana CLI

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash

this will take sometime so don't panic and wait until it finish.

after successful installation you'll get output like this -

(using helius rpc since it works flawlessly)

7. Exporting wallet to backpack

cat ~/.config/solana/id.json

(copy the numbers including [] and open backpack-> import->privatekey->paste to import)
